# TYPO3 CMS Extension Dashboard
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TYPO3-Initiatives/dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TYPO3-Initiatives/dashboard)

In this repository the [TYPO3 Dashboard initiative](https://typo3.org/community/teams/typo3-development/initiatives/typo3-dashboard-initiative/) will create a proof of concept of a Dashboard extension for TYPO3. When the extension is production ready, we will move this extension to TYPO3 core.

Please check the page of the [TYPO3 Dashboard initiative](https://typo3.org/community/teams/typo3-development/initiatives/typo3-dashboard-initiative/) to see the goals of the initiative.


##Work in progress!
**PLEASE TRY THE EXTENSION, BUT BE AWARE THAT THIS EXTENSION IS NOT PROVEN TO BE STABLE ENOUGH FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**
